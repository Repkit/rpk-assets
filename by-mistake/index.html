        <p>I hope that in this year to come, you make <strong>mistakes</strong>. Because if you are making <strong>mistakes</strong>, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.</p>

        <p>If you live long enough, you'll make <strong>mistakes</strong>. But if you learn from them, you'll be a better person. It's how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit.</p>

        <p>I'm selfish, impatient, and a little insecure. I make <strong>mistakes</strong>, I'm out of control, and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.</p>

        <p>You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the <strong>mistakes</strong>, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.</p>

        <p>Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make <strong>mistakes</strong> and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.</p>
